# Aperture — project instructions

Traps in this repo that typecheck cleanly and fail later. Each one cost a debug
cycle before it was written down.

## Imports in `src/lib` that tests reach

`npm test` runs `src/**/*.test.ts` under bare node (`--experimental-strip-types`),
which does **not** resolve the `@/` alias — only the bundler does. A module a
test imports, directly or transitively, must use a relative path **with the
`.ts` extension**:

```ts
import { planById } from "../billing/plans.ts";   // resolves in both
import { planById } from "@/lib/billing/plans";   // typechecks, dies in tests
```

`tsc --noEmit` passes either way, so the test suite is the only thing that
catches this. It has bitten `plans.ts`, `preview-check.ts` and `run.server.ts`.

Type-only imports are erased, so `import type { X } from "@/lib/…"` is fine.

## TypeScript node's stripper does not support

Type stripping removes types; it does not transform syntax that emits code.
Parameter properties are the one that keeps appearing:

```ts
constructor(private readonly x: T) {}        // fails at runtime
constructor(x: T) { this.x = x; }            // fine
```

Same class of problem: `enum`, decorators, namespaces.

## Never commit `.vercel/output` from a partial build

`npm run build` is `vite build` **plus** `copy-pglite-assets` **plus**
`db:migrate`. Running `vite build` alone produces an output tree with the pglite
wasm assets deleted. Verify a build if you like, then
`git checkout -- .vercel && git clean -fd .vercel` before committing.

## Tests are globbed

`npm test` takes `'scripts/**/*.test.mjs' 'src/**/*.test.ts'`. Do not reintroduce
a hardcoded file list — one previously hid 167 tests behind a `&&`
short-circuit, and new test files were silently never run.

One process runs both suites, so a failure in either is reported and neither is
skipped.

## Verification that CI cannot do

CI runs typecheck, lint and test. Some guarantees are not reachable that way and
were checked by hand; if you change the code beneath them, re-check the same way:

- **Workspace sync** — that a stale-revision write touches zero rows was proven
  by running the migration and the conditional update against PGLite directly.
- **Persistence end to end** — that work survives cleared site data was proven by
  driving a browser: edit, "Saved", clear storage, reload.
- **The preview Scripts toggle** — security-relevant, verified by clicking it.
- **`src/lib/sandbox/vercel.server.ts` has never run at all.** Its request shapes
  come from API docs, not from a successful call.

Unit tests and a green typecheck have repeatedly passed over real bugs in this
repo: a sync that never persisted its revision, a hash taken before seeding
rather than after, an adapter nobody has exercised. Run the thing.

## Auth and the database

Auth is **on** here, so `.grok/app-env.json` carries no `VITE_AUTH_ENABLED` and
the flag defaults on. Several `scripts/*.test.mjs` assert the Grok template's
shipped defaults; they are hermetic now, exercising the mechanism against a
fixture rather than this workspace's configuration. Keep them that way rather
than re-pinning them to whatever the repo currently holds.

Run locally with `VITE_AUTH_ENABLED=false` and no `DATABASE_URL` to get the dev
user and PGLite. Never set that flag false *and* a `DATABASE_URL` — the auth
layer throws on that combination by design.
